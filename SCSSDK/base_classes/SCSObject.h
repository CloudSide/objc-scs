/*!SCSObject */
/*!Objects are the fundamental entities stored in SCS. Objects are composed of object data and
 metadata. The data portion is opaque to SCS. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that
 describe the object. These include some default metadata such as the date last modified, and standard
 HTTP metadata such as Content-Type. The developer may also specify custom metadata at the time the
 Object is stored.
